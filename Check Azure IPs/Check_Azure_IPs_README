The purpose of this script is to extract Australian region IPv4 Azure IPs and place these in a text file. 

It emails the result of whether the script ran successfully.

To ensure that the output file is upto date, the script checks if the output file is existing, if so it will remove this before writing to it.

If you would like to include IPv6 addresses, remove line 38.
