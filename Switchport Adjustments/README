Script will iterate through switch and perform the following:

Check for VLAN 999 config & create VLAN 999 if not present. Then set this as the primary VLAN 
Check for down interfaces that are enabled on 3-6, 40-52 
Check for down interfaces that are already disabled on 40-52 
If ports are in ap_int_down and remaining_int_down, change to VLAN 999 untagged and disable 
If ports are in disabled_ports and don't have VLAN 999 untagged, apply VLAN 999 untagged 
Set WAN port to VLAN 999 untagged 
Set floor ports 7-40 to VLAN 999 untagged if not already

You need to have hp_procurve_show_vlans_int_XX_detail.textfsm in your python script directory as I can't work out how to get this into ntc templates index correctly. 

You also need to have the switch host name file present to import.
